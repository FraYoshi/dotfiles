Linux Configurations Files

These are my personal preferences for the some Linux applications, feel free to explore and copy as long as you follow the licence terms.

# How to add files
All the files and directories are excluded.
in order to add them an `-f` or `--force` flag is used.
or an esclamation mark 「`!`」 is added on the `.gitignore`
